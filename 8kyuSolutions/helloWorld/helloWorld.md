# Hello World

The given problem was to create a function called greet that would return "hello world!"

The solution was to create a function and ensure it was called greet.
This fucntion then returned the string "hello world!".

To test this in VisualCodeStudio I added console.log(greet())
This would then show me the return of the function in the terminal.
