The problem here is to create a function that can determine wether a given number is even or odd.

Solution 1
I created a function using an if/else statement that used the modulus operator to divide the given number by 2 and record if there was a remainder.
If the remainder was equal to 0 then it would return Even to the terminal.
If the remainder was not equal to 0 then it would return Odd to the terminal.

Solution 2
This solution is identicle in its function to Solution 1 but it has been written as a ternery operation. 
This was completed after being shown ternery operator during a session.
