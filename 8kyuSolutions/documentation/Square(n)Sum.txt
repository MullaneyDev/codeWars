Description
Complete the square sum function so that it squares each number passed into it and then sums the results together.

For example, for [1, 2, 2] it should return 9 because 1²+2²+2²=9

First I looped through the given array and squared each answer
I then pushed this to a new array (answerArray)

Then i looped through the answerArray and added each value to the total
I then returned this total to give the final answer
